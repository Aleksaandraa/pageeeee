Patriotsfuture.com does not sell anything to the general public, and all advertisements displayed on patriotsfuture.com are merely advertisements displayed in the capacity of a wholesaler acting to direct potential customers to the site of ClickBank inc. (the retailer). All potential buyers are first directed to ClickBank inc.’s site before buying, via the use of hyperlinks. Therefore, any and all contractual relationships which are created when purchasing an item advertised on this site exist solely between the customer and ClickBank inc.
